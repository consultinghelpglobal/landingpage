**McKinsey Study**
Beautify’s president and COO engaged McKinsey to help evaluate if training the majority of beauty consultants to use virtual channels to connect with customers could be profitable for the company.

**Question 1:**
Beautify is excited to support its current staff of beauty consultants on the journey to becoming virtual social media-beauty advisors. Consultants would still lead the way in terms of direct consumer engagement and would be expected to maintain and grow a group of clients. They would sell products through their own pages on beautify.com, make appearances at major retail outlets, and be active on all social media platforms.

What possible factors should Beautify consider when shifting this group of employees toward a new set of responsibilities?

**Answer**
Some of the factors you might discuss with your interviewer could include:

Retailer response. How will retailers respond to consumers buying directly from beautify.com? What kinds of financial arrangements will Beautify have to work out with its retail partners?

Competitor response. Do other beauty companies offer virtual assistants? If yes, how successful are they? If no, do they have plans to digitize the personal selling experience?

Current capabilities. What is the current skill set of beauty consultants regarding social media? How many already have an online presence, for example, those with more professional accounts on social media platforms or a personal beauty or skincare blog? Would it be possible to hire new advisors with these marketing skills?

Brand image. What are the implications for Beautify’s brand if hundreds of advisors suddenly start posting about its products? How could this be leveraged to make Beautify seem more attractive as an employer in the market?
